The Future Developer Club recently hosted an exciting two-session workshop on Git and GitHub,
one of the most essential tools for modern developers.
With a hands-on approach, this event brought together students eager to learn how to manage code collaboratively,
track changes, and contribute effectively to projects.
The workshop concluded with participants performing their very first git push, marking the beginning of their journey in version control.

## A Two-Session Deep Dive into Git & GitHub

### Session 1: Getting Started with Git

The first session focused on the fundamentals:

- **Introduction to Version Control**: Why version control matters and its importance in software development.
- **Setting Up Git**: Installing Git and configuring it for first-time use.
- **Core Git Commands**: Learning commands like `git init`, `git add`, and `git commit` to create and manage repositories locally.

Participants gained a clear understanding of how to set up a repository and track changes efficiently.

### Session 2: Exploring GitHub

The second session shifted focus to GitHub, the collaborative hub for developers worldwide:

- **Creating a GitHub Account**: Setting up profiles and personalizing them.
- **Working with Remote Repositories**: Cloning repositories, pushing changes, and creating pull requests.
- **Collaboration Basics**: Understanding forks, branches, and merge conflicts.

The highlight of the session was performing a `git push`, where participants successfully uploaded their local repositories to GitHub, turning their knowledge into practical action.

## Key Takeaways from the Workshop

By the end of the two sessions, attendees had:

- Set up Git and GitHub on their systems.
- Learned how to create and manage repositories both locally and remotely.
- Gained hands-on experience in pushing code to a remote repository.
- Understood the basics of collaborative development workflows.

## A Glimpse Into the Event

Here are some moments captured during the workshop:

- Participants learning the basics of Git commands.
- Students collaborating to resolve merge conflicts.
- Celebrating the successful `git push` at the end of the workshop.

## What's Next?

With this foundational knowledge, the Future Developer Club is set to host more advanced sessions on topics like branching strategies, pull requests, and open-source contributions. This workshop is just the beginning of many exciting events aimed at equipping our students with the skills to excel in the tech industry.
Stay tuned for upcoming workshops, and let's keep pushing boundariesâ€”one `git push` at a time!
